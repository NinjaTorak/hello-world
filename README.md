		<p>starmade is a fun sand box and survival game.you can bilde ships or bye ships and you can mine for resorses or bye them. when you spawn you are next to a shop and star with 20,000 credets(that whont get you that far).</p>
		<p>I love this game and the free demo is just like the game(but it dose not have the sand box mode) so you should try it, it is sooper</p>
		<p>there ar planets(that look very real) and over 9 quadrillions starsustems</p>

	<p>Starmade is fun but it is a hard game depending on what sort fo staton you cum acros soon there will be drones garding abandond statons and there are piret statons + the trading guild have statons.</p>
